# Hi, I'm Yijin

**PhD in Statistics & Machine Learning (Imperial College London)**  
I design methods for **two-sample testing**, **statistical association**, and **change-point detection** under **missing data** (MCAR/MAR/MNAR). I care about theory you can ship: valid inference + practical, reproducible code.

- 🔬 Research interests: nonparametric testing, rank statistics, dependence measures, time series, robust ML
- 🧪 Methods I work with: MMD, WMW, Spearman/Kendall, permutation/bootstraps, encoder–decoder RNNs
- 💻 Tools: Python, R, PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy/Pandas, scikit-learn, tidymodels
- ⚙️ Values: clarity, reproducibility, small APIs, measured claims

## 📦 Research & code
- Repos include **README-first** docs, minimal APIs, and examples.
- Where possible I add: `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml`, seeds, `Makefile`/`justfile`, and CI.
- I’m adding `CITATION.cff` and LICENSE files across projects so others can cite & reuse.

## 📈 What I’m up to
- Tight bounds + tests for rank-based statistics with missing data (Spearman footrule, Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ)
- Robust two-sample testing with MMD under MNAR
- Practical evaluations: walk-forward validation and cost-aware metrics
