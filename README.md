# Hi, I'm Yijin

**PhD in Statistics & Machine Learning (Imperial College London), currently enrolled in the Statistics and Machine Learning Centre for Doctoral Training ([StatML CDT](<https://statml.io>))**  
My PhD research focuses on developing novel methodologies for statistical two-sample hypothesis testing, statistical association, and change point detection in the presence of missing data, especially when the missing data are informative. Applications include A/B testing, clinical trials, information retrieval, and continual learning. A key goal of my work is to enable valid and robust statistical inference in the presence of missing data, a common challenge in real-world scenarios. 

Make sure to check my work if you are interested!
