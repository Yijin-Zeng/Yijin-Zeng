# Hi, I'm Yijin

**PhD in Statistics & Machine Learning at Imperial College London, currently enrolled in the Statistics and Machine Learning Centre for Doctoral Training ([StatML CDT](<https://statml.io>)) by Imperial \& Oxford.**

A link to my [CV](https://yijin-zeng.github.io/cv.pdf).

My PhD research focuses on developing novel methodologies for statistical two-sample hypothesis testing, statistical association, and change point detection in the presence of missing data, especially when the missing data are informative. Applications include A/B testing, casual inference, information retrieval, and continual learning. A key goal of my work is to enable valid and robust statistical inference in the presence of missing data, a common challenge in real-world scenarios. 

Make sure to check my work if you are interested!
